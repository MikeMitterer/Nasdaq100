Hint
========
	If you use [www.defaulticon.com][9] icons in your Android project it's very easy to generate your own iconsets for Android.
	(At least on Linux or Mac OS)
	
	check out the [script][11] in doc/bin/genAndroidIcons. (Don't forget to chmod 700 doc/bin/genAndroidIcons)
	(Tested on Mac OSX 10.8.2, should also work on Linux. Sorry Windows-User, no script for you)
	[Here][12] you can see one of the preview-files the script generates.
	The preview.png was generated with a border and a shadow so that it's easier do see the thumbnail dimensions.
	
	A possible file structure the script generates:
