Nasdaq100
=========
This App shows you the top Nasdaq100 companies with their logo's. If you select one of these companies it
shows you it's Wikipedia entry. Another option is to display a chart image of the last 3 month.

Intention / OpenSource
======================
On reason to OpenSource this App was to show a real live Application with Fragments, ActionBarSherlock,
Roboguice, targeting different Android versions, different devices (N1, Tablet aso.) and AdMob in one place. 
It's also a tribute to all the OpenSource stuff I use.

Development / Settings
============
It should be easy to setup for you. The only tricky part is to add ActionBarSherlock.
Under [doc/dependency/][13] I have added the ActionBarSherlock version I use.
These screenshots should help to setup the project for you:

Scripts
========
#### genAndroidIcons
If you use [www.defaulticon.com][9] icons in your Android project it's very easy to generate your own iconsets for Android.
(At least on Linux or Mac OS)
	
check out the [script][11] in doc/bin/genAndroidIcons. (Don't forget to chmod 700 doc/bin/genAndroidIcons)
(Tested on Mac OSX 10.8.2, should also work on Linux. Sorry Windows-User, no script for you)
[Here][12] you can see one of the preview-files the script generates.
The preview.png was generated with a border and a shadow so that it's easier do see the thumbnail dimensions.
	
A possible file structure the script generates:

#### tagdev
If you have more than one physical device connected to your PC and if you want
to use the command-line with ant you have to specify the serial number of your target device to help ant (+ adb)
to copy the apk to the right location.
[tagdev][14] should help.

Sample:
- $ doc/bin/tagdev --list
- $ . doc/bin/tagdev --alias device1
- $ ant installr

And agin - sorry dear Windows-User. Maybe [Cygwin][15] can help...
